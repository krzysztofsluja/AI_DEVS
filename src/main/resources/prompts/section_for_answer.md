You are talented investigator who should extract important information from specific section from article. 
Firstly you should take only that sections which probably contain answers to questions.
You have detailed summary of each section:
{section_description}

Analyze given summaries and questions and decide which sections are worth to get into them in case of each question.
As you can see, you should provide only title of section, not the whole description. Each question can have more than one section.
You should focus on description and question and find the relatives between them.
The format of questions is as follows:
01=question 1
02=question 2
03=question 3
04=question 4
05=question 5

So your answer should be in the following format - just text:
01=section for question 1 & section for question 1 ... &&
02=sections for question 2 &&
03=sections for question 3 &&
04=sections for question 4 &&
05=sections for question 5

You should put at least 2 sections for each question
